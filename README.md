.NET Web API Application that showcase microservices in AWS Cloud native architecture.

This is an evolving project as I  will be committing changes often.

The main idea is the create base services, to run them in containers in integrate them with PostgreSQL and event streaming such as Apache Kaftka.

Eventually, this project will migrate to EKS (Kubernetes).
